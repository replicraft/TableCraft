# Application sessions and tasks

`tablecraft-runtime` owns the desktop's working native read session, command
execution and background worker. It has no egui/eframe dependency. The desktop
owns native windows and dialogs, forwards commands and moves owned results into
the shared UI's presentation types. Engine interpretation stays in ACE, Access
adapts it, and query evaluation stays in the query libraries.

## Session and task ownership

Open captures an immutable image of a stable/offline file up to 64 MiB, closing
the original handle after the bounded copy. It checks length before and after;
this does not establish a transactional snapshot against same-size concurrent
writes. Close other writers first. Package selection and native password/page
decoding use the existing Access/ACE services. Passwords are consumed into
zeroizing storage, including on failures. Opening a source never executes its
active content or follows stored external paths.

The worker owns the session and one replaceable pending request and response.
New commands supersede older work through generation cancellation; publication
and host acceptance both reject stale generations. Pending replacement and old
result clearing share the mailbox lock; backend work runs outside it. Dropping a
worker requests cancellation without joining on the GUI thread. A blocking OS
file-open/read call must return before a cooperative cancellation check can run.

| Command | Owned response and scope |
| --- | --- |
| Open | Inert catalog and format; a failed replacement clears the old session |
| Page | One buffered table page with typed scalar/stored-field cells |
| Describe | Field declarations and reader facts, without user-record scans |
| InspectCollection | Complete stored children of one revision-bound native parent cell |
| Query | Explicit read-query result over the selected source; no implicit provider opens |

Describe's reader NULL policy is separate from Required/default/validation
properties, which it does not inspect. Unknown field declarations remain visible.
Metadata does not establish whole-table readability or permission to write.

## Table cells and stored collections

Page uses `NativeBrowser::browse_page` once. Metadata selects ordinary scalar
paging or the existing qualified stored-field profile. Failed reads are not
retried as another profile. Unknown, corrupt or unqualified columns refuse the
operation rather than disappearing from the page or becoming empty collections.
Checked page EOF controls the Next action; page size and declared row count do
not substitute for it.

Each cell owns its display text and explicit reader facts:

- Scalar cells carry independent NULL and stored-calculation flags. Literal text
  `NULL` does not acquire NULL semantics from its spelling. Cached NULL results
  retain both flags; no formula evaluates and freshness remains unknown.
- Exact Boolean values carry `Some(true/false)` separately from display text;
  text/numeric lookalikes and expression-only states never acquire that fact.
  `DisplayControl` independently distinguishes uninspected metadata, a verified
  absent declaration, the exact native signed control code and an unsupported
  declaration. It does not supply a guessed field default.
- Multivalue, attachment and stored-history cells carry assigned-key presence and
  a complete member count. An absent key differs from an assigned empty list.
  Duplicate and NULL elements count. An attachment whose FileData is NULL remains
  a member. All typed items must validate before the count is published.
- Current Memo text remains a separate scalar from stored version membership.
  Display does not select a latest version or infer timestamps from ordering.

Parent-page cells contain collection summaries. Explicit child inspection returns
a separate complete scalar table; attachment payload bytes are not included. The underlying stored-field
reader is eager: it validates complete parent/child snapshots and retains encoded
attachments before returning a visible page. This is bounded complete-read
behavior, not lazy expansion or constant memory. No attachment decoder, URL
resolver, file export or external application is invoked by browsing.

The shared UI renders values before compact annotations, retains provenance in
tooltips/accessibility context and copies the complete display text without its
badge. Display strings are not lossless exports, edit carriers or a general native
field-formatting engine. Query Empty/Missing/error states remain explicit display
states; they are not silently converted to stored NULL.

Native Page preflights the actual `MSysObjects` schema for its property carrier,
then inspects present property storage under the same cumulative native budget
that is moved into the browser. A successfully inspected catalog without that
carrier yields `Uninspected`; actual metadata/read/framing/cancellation/limit
errors propagate. Property and page object identities must match. Field names
join only column-scoped groups, and exact DDL-flagged Int16 declarations retain
their original codes. Unknown flags, carriers or widths are `Unsupported` rather
than absent. Presentation work charges the name lookups and cell enrichment.
Query results and explicit child contents remain `Uninspected`: aliases or a
parent collection's settings do not establish native field provenance.

Shared UI shows a read-only checkbox only for a non-NULL typed Boolean with an
explicit native checkbox control (106). Text-box, combo-box and unknown controls
retain the stored display text; absent/uninspected controls remain explicit.
Full-value Copy and cached-result provenance are unchanged. See the
[desktop presentation record](../ui/DESKTOP.md).

## Native Boolean field Format

Native pages now apply the qualified predefined `Yes/No`, `True/False` and
`On/Off` Format names to non-NULL typed Boolean cells with an explicit TextBox
DisplayControl (109). The current English presentation policy supplies `Yes`/
`No`, `True`/`False` and `On`/`Off`; neither database LCID nor ambient OS locale
chooses those labels. Other locale policies remain unimplemented.

The original table identity and column-scoped property group must already be
bound by the page reader. Format requires its native DDL flag and Text carrier.
Missing, unknown or unsupported declarations retain the original display value;
actual property read/framing/cancellation/resource errors still fail the page.
CheckBox (106) retains its read-only checkbox and previous full-value copy text;
combo-box, absent and unknown controls do not gain text-box behavior. NULL stays
NULL, and cached-result provenance remains separate from these display labels.
No formatted string is reparsed into a stored value or replacement input.

The shared UI copies the full resulting display text. Native property bytes and
stored values remain unchanged; queries and explicit collection contents do not
inherit a parent field format. Custom format sections, numeric/date formats,
DecimalPlaces and Caption headers are outside this slice. See Microsoft's
[Yes/No formatting contract](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/access/format-a-yes-no-data-type).
This is a documented presentation policy with synthetic native-property tests,
not a new Microsoft Access differential or locale-compatibility claim.

## Explicit collection inspection

Each executed Open attempt advances a checked worker-local document revision,
including a failed Open. It identifies the captured immutable session, not an
on-disk file version, durable bookmark or write capability. Opened responses expose
it; native table pages carry `source_revision: Some(revision)`. Query results and
child tables carry None, so they cannot be mistaken for native parent ordinals.

InspectCollection supplies that revision, the original table/column names and
global parent ordinal. The service rejects stale revisions before native reads,
then reuses one-parent `browse_page` and its typed collection items. Missing
parents, missing columns, scalar cells and corrupt children are explicit errors.
This rereads complete qualified collection snapshots under the existing budgets;
it is not a lazy child reader. The requested global offset is applied once.

Multivalue contents retain order, duplicates and NULL elements. Attachment rows
retain the signed stored child ID and nullable name, type, URL, timestamp, flags
and encoded-byte count; absent FileData differs from present encoded bytes of
length zero. No payload is decoded, extracted or opened, and metadata URLs remain
plain text. History retains stored order and signed child identities, with nullable
Memo/time values separate from current Memo text. Timestamp columns distinguish
rounded civil display from exact original DATE bits; an unavailable civil display
is labelled explicitly while the raw value remains present.

The shared UI admits only typed collection cells in the current native page.
An explicit context-menu action or plain Enter opens a loading/result/error modal.
The modal owns keyboard input and keeps the underlying page/query/schema intact.
Replies must match its still-open task ID and full source/parent target; closing,
replacing the source or changing the underlying view prevents late reopening.
Closing an old dialog cannot cancel a newer request. Native decoding and revision
checks stay in runtime; desktop moves DTOs and routes results.

## Reviewed offline cell edits

The optional `offline-edit` feature supplies BeginEdit/ReviewEdit on the read
worker and a separate `SaveWorker`. Desktop enables it. Drafts use exact document
revision/table/column/ordinal targets; they retain no offline lease while the
user types. Runtime converts replacement text to typed values and invokes normal
native planning. SQL is never generated from the input. The shared UI's review
is a display DTO; only the runtime can issue its opaque consuming `ReviewedEdit`.

The capture is shared through Bytes between the reader and review precondition.
Apply acquires the existing exclusive offline session and compares the complete
physical image before resolving fresh snapshot-local handles and reconstructing
the native plan. Encrypted/package sources remain read-only for this route.
Backend validation, required programs, write profiles and resource controls still
apply. See [offline session ownership](../access/writes/OFFLINE_WRITE_SESSIONS.md).

Save work is nonreplaceable: a newer read generation cannot discard its terminal
outcome. Reports distinguish known commit/rollback facts, retained resources,
recovery eligibility and acknowledged release. Cancellation requests stopping;
it is not a rollback receipt. Recovery/release consume the retained owner through
explicit operations. Busy/stale starts return the unconsumed capability.
Known committed edits are never replayed as recovery attempts.

The host blocks source replacement and window closure while an accepted save
remains unacknowledged. A successful acknowledged save reopens its source and
refreshes only the table/page bound to that exact reopen generation. Failed or
released uncertain outcomes cannot leave the old snapshot masquerading as current.
Incomplete setup offers explicit resource release while preserving any existing
or partial journal entries for diagnosis. Uncertain release still denies retry;
the current UI has no general restart/recovery browser for that state. Reports
show the current operation outcome separately from the last completed receipt,
including its available row counts. A release failure cannot hide a completed
commit, and a previous receipt cannot be promoted to the current attempt.

The default reserved `.FILENAME.tablecraft-journal` sibling blocks reopening
while present, including a symlink, without following or deleting it. This only
detects that active reserved path. Journal retirement renames bundles, so a crash
after rename can leave an undiscovered retired sibling. Other caller-selected
bundles and path aliases are not a general journal-discovery mechanism. Keep the
explicit offline and outstanding-journal preconditions; this is not Access
multiuser locking or complete crash-restart recovery.

Normal filesystem editing currently works only on macOS/Linux. Other platforms
return an explicit unsupported result. This reviewed-cell workflow is a bounded
offline workflow, not Access autosave, record navigation or query-result
updateability parity.

## Native saved queries and declared parameters

Open now publishes table and saved-query declarations from one inert
`NativeBrowser::inventory` capture. The native adapter retains all catalog kinds
and original identities; the current UI presents Tables and Queries. Opening
reconstructs no query body and executes no query or user code. Both catalog-to-DTO
passes charge/check every entry, including kinds omitted from these two lists.

`InspectSavedQuery` supplies a worker-local document revision, full scoped object
ID and original name. It reconstructs the supported owned read syntax through
`NativeSource::read_saved_query` and returns declared parameter specifications.
Revision is checked before native loading, then both ID and exact name are
checked against the reconstructed definition. Inspection does not bind sources,
scan user records or establish execution readiness. Unsupported action,
pass-through or malformed definitions remain visible catalog declarations and
return explicit errors when inspected.

`RunSavedQuery` is a separate request with literal named inputs. The query-owned
`resolve_parameter_type` supplies carrier and length/precision constraints, so
prompts do not duplicate SQL type lowering. Declared scalar kinds stay fixed;
VALUE requires an explicit concrete kind. NULL is an independent flag. Missing,
duplicate, unknown or mismatched inputs fail; unknown column errors do not invent
parameter prompts. Text is literal data, with no SQL interpolation or VBA call.
The same shared scalar conversion service supports editing and these inputs;
editing retains its exact unchanged DATE/float-carrier rule separately.

Input admission is at most 256 parameters and 1 MiB of cumulative UTF-8 names,
kinds and text, including retained text beside NULL. The UI checks before cloning
an action; runtime checks independently. Metadata/input conversion has its own
bounded scratch allowance, separate from query execution and final display
publication. A single native source and cumulative native allowance cover saved
reconstruction and subsequent execution/schema discovery. Query and display
limits remain the existing controls below.

Execution uses the existing SELECT/UNION/crosstab profile and schema-discovery
service. No external source registry, stored connection, provider, clock, random
state or VBA authority is added. Required unsupported policies remain explicit
errors. Text comparison uses the stored policies described below; the host does
not guess unsupported policies, a locale or LIKE mode. General Access query
updateability remains separate work.

Saved results are complete buffered query results with no native source revision,
zero offset and no progressive suffix. The shared UI rejects a native/partial or
wrong-offset response instead of removing its provenance. Success/error replies
must still match the selected query, request and exact submitted inputs. Dirty
inputs clear their old result; a failed rerun with unchanged inputs retains and
labels the previous successful output. Saved and ad-hoc SQL text/results retain
separate selection slots. None of these results grants native edit, record or
collection-target capability.

## Native query text policies

Both ad-hoc SQL and explicit saved-query runs configure the Access adapter's
deferred database-default resolver before schema discovery. Available Text fields
retain their exact native policy identities; literal/default expressions use the
actual stored database descriptor. The existing General legacy/2010 and
comparison-only French legacy providers remain provisional native-weight models,
not Windows Access SQL qualification.

An unsupported default does not block numeric execution or plain projection.
Supported field policies remain usable independently. An operation that requires
an unsupported field/default policy fails explicitly, with no ordinal, system
locale or another-family fallback. Corrupt metadata, cancellation and resource
errors still fail during configuration. The same source/native allowance covers
saved reconstruction and execution; inspection alone configures no text policy.

One separate cumulative comparison pool allows 16 MiB and 1,000,000 steps per
query, shared by all resolved families and nested execution. It is independent
of native I/O, query execution and display quotas. The host supplies no omitted
VBA module Option Compare setting; explicit binary and supported database string
comparison modes retain their own contracts.

LIKE grammar remains a separate setting. Explicit query runs read the native
database property map through its checked Databases/MSysDb catalog roles, under
the same cumulative native allowance. Qualified `ANSI Query Mode` LONG/DDL values
0 and 1 select ANSI-89 and ANSI-92 respectively. The actual example supplies 0;
the 1 mapping has reference-supported synthetic checks, not a native Access
execution comparison. Missing or unsupported observations leave LIKE unavailable
without blocking numeric execution. Malformed metadata, role, cancellation and
resource failures propagate rather than becoming a guessed default.

Microsoft documents the
[per-database ANSI-89/ANSI-92 choice](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/access/access-wildcard-character-reference).
This does not implement every SQL-mode difference. Database sort order,
application version and operating-system locale do not establish the option.
See [database properties](../access/schema/NATIVE_PROPERTIES.md) and
[native comparison admission](../access/queries/NATIVE_QUERIES.md).

## Limits and verification

Each native operation currently receives 512 MiB of charged bytes, 100,000 rows
and 5,000,000 work steps. Visible pages request 100 records. Stored-field pages
also retain the existing default complete parent/child snapshot ceiling of
16,384 rows; a small visible page does not bypass that ceiling. Ordinary scalar
pages keep their paged profile instead of taking that complete snapshot.

Query execution independently uses 16 MiB, 10,000 rows and 1,000,000 steps, with a
64 KiB SQL input ceiling. Display publication has an 8 MiB budget and 100,000
steps, including typed row/cell envelopes and collection iteration. These are
consumer controls, not format limits or an exact process-heap cap. Partial
pages/counts are not published after failure. Generation checks remain necessary
even when cancellation is requested.

Feature-local runtime tests use the public Worker and existing testkit inputs.
They cover immutable reads, failed opens/password retry, real queries, metadata,
stored caches, collection presence/counts, corrupt child refusal and mailbox
ordering/cancellation. Shared UI tests exercise copy, focus, provenance and
virtualization; these do not qualify native screen readers or Access behavior.
Native observations and current platform limits are recorded in the
[desktop guide](../ui/DESKTOP.md). Payload-free diagnostics remain governed by
[the tracing contract](../development/TRACING.md).
